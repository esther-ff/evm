# EVM and Theres

This repo contains the source code for my (awful) virtual machine
(the acronym means "Esther's Virtual Machine")

and the source code for the compiler for a language (named "Theres") that is going to target it.

# TODO:
## (for Theres)
- Type checking
- Clean out the code
- Some sort of IR for typing
- Some sort of IR for codegen
- Maybe optimizations
- Desugaring
